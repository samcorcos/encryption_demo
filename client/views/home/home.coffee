#I'm going to store the variables for the calculation in the client-side collection


# ## COMPUTING THE KEYS
# # 1) Choose 2 distinct prime numbers, p and q.
# p = 5
# q = 11

# # 2) n is the modulus for both public and private keys. The bits of n is the key length
# n = p*q

# # 3) phi is Eulers totient function which is the amount of numbers less than n that are coprime with p and q.
# phi = (p-1)*(q-1)

# # 4) Choose 1<e<phi such that phi and e are coprime. Choosing a prime number is an easy choice ;)
# # e is released as the "public key exponent"
# e = 3

# # 5) find d by computing the multiplicative modular inverse.
# # e.i. solve for d: e*d mod phi = 1
# # d is keps as the "private key exponent"
# d = 1
# while int(divmod(e*d,phi)[1]) != 1:
# 	d = d+1

# # 6) the keys:
# pubKey = (e,n)
# privKey = (d,n)
#

# ## MESSAGE ENCRYPTION
# # 1) first choose a message
# m = 13
# # 2) encrypt the message as m^e mod phi
# eMsg = int(divmod(pow(m,e),phi)[1])
# # 3) dencrypt the message as eMsg^d mod phi
# dMsg = int(divmod(pow(eMsg,d),phi)[1])
